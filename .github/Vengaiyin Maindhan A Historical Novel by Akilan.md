The novel begins with Vandiyathevan arriving at the Chola capital of Thanjavur, where he meets the king's elder brother and chief minister Aniruddha Brahmarayar. He delivers a message from the king, who is away on a military campaign in Sri Lanka. The message contains a secret code that only the king and his sister Kundavai can understand. Vandiyathevan also meets Nandini, the beautiful and mysterious wife of Brahmarayar, who has a mysterious influence over him.
 
Vandiyathevan then travels to Pazhayarai, the seat of Kundavai, who is also the leader of a secret society called the Ananda Vikatan, which works for the welfare of the Chola empire. He becomes friends with Alwarkadiyan Nambi, a Vaishnava saint and spy, who guides him in his mission. He also meets Vanathi, the niece of Kundavai, who falls in love with him at first sight.
 
Vandiyathevan's mission is to find out the truth behind a conspiracy that threatens to overthrow Rajendra Chola and replace him with his cousin and rival Madhuranthaka. The conspiracy is led by a mysterious figure called Ravidasan, who claims to be the son of Veerapandiyan, the former king of Pandya Nadu, who was killed by Rajaraja Chola I, the father of Rajendra Chola. Ravidasan has allied with some disgruntled Chola nobles and generals, as well as some foreign powers like the Sinhalese and the Arabs.
  
Vandiyathevan travels to various places in the Chola empire and beyond, such as Kanchi, Kadambur, Uraiyur, Thirupurambiyam, Thirunelveli, Kadamboor, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. He encounters many dangers and enemies, such as assassins, spies, traitors, rebels and pirates. He also meets many friends and allies, such as Azhwarkadiyan's sister Thirukkannamangai, the Chera prince Ponniyin Selvan, the Pandya prince Sundara Pandyan and the Sinhalese princess Manimekalai.
 
Vandiyathevan also learns more about the history and legends of the Chola dynasty, such as the story of Karikalan, the founder of the dynasty, who built the famous Kallanai dam across the Kaveri river; the story of Manimekalai, the daughter of Karikalan, who was cursed by a sage to wander the earth until she finds her true love; and the story of Aditya Karikalan, the elder brother of Rajendra Chola and Kundavai, who was murdered by unknown assailants.
 
The novel reaches its climax when Vandiyathevan finally confronts Ravidasan and his allies in a fierce battle at Thirupurambiyam. He also discovers the shocking truth behind Ravidasan's identity and his connection to Nandini. He also reunites with Vanathi and Manimekalai, who both love him dearly. He has to make a difficult choice between them. The novel ends with Rajendra Chola returning victorious from his campaign and celebrating his coronation as the emperor of India.
